%
\section{Time Requirement}
Each \marginnote{-0.1in}{The time required will depend on your level of preparation and ability to focus. Estimates are for a typical student.} of the two weekly course meetings is 110 minutes in length, requiring a total of 3.67 hours per week. For each meeting you can expect to spend about 2 hours outside of class reading, studying, and working exercises. Problem sets will require about five hours during weeks they are assigned. 
%
% --- CONTENT ---
%
\section{Content}
This course is an introduction to statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, and chemical kinetics with an emphasis on molecular derivation and interpretation of macroscopic properties and behaviors. The course topics are listed in Table~\ref{tab:topics}.  
%
% --- Table: Course Topics ---
%
\begin{table}[h]
\caption{\sffamily Topics covered in Chemistry 351}
\label{tab:topics}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1}
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l} \toprule
Probability and Statistics & Second Law & Real Gases \\
Boltzmann Distribution  & Physical Equilibrium & Chemical Kinetics \\
Partition Functions      & Chemical Equilibrium & Reaction Mechanisms \\
Statistical Thermodynamics    & Thermochemistry & Chemical Dynamics \\
First Law     & Kinetic Gas Theory & Catalysis \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\marginnote{-0.64in}{Topics are not necessarily covered in this order, and not all topics are covered with equal depth.}

Statistical mechanics connects the properties of atoms and molecules to the bulk properties of matter manifested in classical thermodynamics. Classical thermodynamics allows the behavior of bulk matter to be predicted without any knowledge of its detailed structure. Chemical kinetics and dynamics allow reaction mechanisms to be predicted and the progress of reactions to be modeled. With these tools, you can predict how Nature behaves under a broad range of conditions. \marginnote{-0.35in}{These are basic tools in any chemist's toolbox for working on chemical problems.}
%
% --- GOALS ---
%
\section{Goals}
In this class I want to
\begin{inparaenum}[\bfseries (a\upshape)]
\item provide you with the tools to understand how statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, and kinetics apply to chemical systems;
\item provide you with the tools to understand statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, and kinetics in the literature of any chemical subject;
\item show you the beauty and regularity of chemistry and Nature that emerge when you understand the most fundamental concepts that underlie everything you have ever experienced;
\item provide you with the tools to form a realistic mental image of how microscopic properties give rise to macroscopic properties;
\item further develop your ability to analyze and interpret experimental results in terms of the microscopic structure and dynamics of atoms and molecules, and 
\item help you understand how we know what we know.
\end{inparaenum}

I also want you to move closer to being a professional in this course. Because of this, additional goals of this course are to
\begin{inparaenum}[\bfseries (a\upshape)]
\item improve your problem solving skills;
\item improve your ability to formulate descriptions of the chemical world in terms of mathematical models, and
\item improve your ability to make clear quantitative arguments.
\end{inparaenum}
%
% --- LEARNING OBJECTIVES ---
%
\section{Learning Objectives}
Learning objectives are things you should be able to do at the end of the course. At the end of the course, you should be able to
\begin{inparaenum}[\bfseries (a\upshape)]
\item explain the meaning and origin of Boltzmann's distribution;
\item calculate thermodynamic properties using molecular properties;
\item state and apply the laws of thermodynamics;
\item use thermodynamic engines to discuss efficiency;
\item predict chemical equilibrium and spontaneity of reactions;
\item use equations of state to determine properties of gaseous systems;
\item explain gas behavior using kinetic gas theory;
\item perform calculations to determine reaction rates;
\item analyze reaction mechanisms in terms of their rate laws, and 
\item model concentration as a function of time for the species involved in any mechanism.
\end{inparaenum}
%
% --- WEEKLY ROUTINE ---
%
\section{Weekly Routine}
Tuesday and Thursday meetings are primarily dedicated to lecture covering the topics listed in the course schedule. \marginnote{-0.1in}{Reading assignments should be read before lecture; exercises should be worked after lecture.} Reading assignments, exercises, and solutions for exercises are provided on the course website for each topic. A problem set is due most weeks other than those with an exam. There are three micro exams and two exams; all are given during a normal Tuesday class meeting. A detailed course schedule can be found on the course website. 
%
% --- THINGS I GRADE ---
%
\section{Things I Grade}
You \marginnote{-0.1in}{The course website lists due dates for all evaluated items.} and I determine your progress in this course using scores derived from evaluating the quality and accuracy of your answers to questions posed in problem sets, micro exams, exams, and a final exam. This section provides details for each of these evaluations
%
% --- Problem Sets ---
%
\subsection{Problem Sets}
Problem \marginnote{-0.1in}{Worth 25\% of course score. Lowest one (1) score is dropped.} sets consist of some straightforward and easy-to-solve questions and some that are more challenging and time consuming. They are assigned almost weekly except during the first week and during weeks with exams; they are due on Thursdays. Problem sets are posted on the course website. Solutions are available in my office and can be reviewed by scheduling an appointment. Each problem set is weighted equally. Your lowest single problem set score is dropped before computing your course score. The course website has detailed guidelines for preparing solutions for problems sets.
%
% --- Micro Exams ---
%
\subsection{Micro Exams}
A \marginnote{-0.1in}{Worth 25\% of course score.} micro exam is given at the start of the Tuesday meeting two weeks prior to each of the two exams and the week before the final exam. The exact date for each of the three micro exams can be found in the course schedule. You will be given 50 minutes to complete each micro exam. The topics covered on each micro exam are listed on the course website. Solutions to micro exams are posted on the course website after they are graded. Each micro exam is weighted equally. 
%
% --- Exams ---
%
\subsection{Exams}
Two \marginnote{-0.1in}{Worth 25\% of course score.} exams are given during the semester. Each is given during a normal Tuesday class meeting. They require the entire class period to complete. All exams are cumulative. Solutions for exams are available in my office and can be reviewed by appointment. See the course website for the exam schedule. Each exam is weighted equally. 
%
% --- Final Exam ---
%
\subsection{Final Exam}
The \marginnote{-0.1in}{Worth 25\% of course score.} final exam is given on the day and in a time slot specified by the Registrar. The final exam is cumulative over the entire semester. No solutions to the final exam are posted, but you may review the grading by making an appointment with me. You may not take possession of the exam. 
%
% --- THINGS I DO NOT GRADE ---
%
\section{Things I Do Not Grade}
Each topic is accompanied by a set of exercises from the required textbooks. These exercises are recommended, but I never collect and grade them. It is, however, essential that you work (or at least review) as many of the exercises as possible. Solutions for exercises are available on the course website. 
%
% --- COURSE SCORE ---
%
\section{Course Score}
Your course score is a weighted average of the scores you earn on problem sets, micro exams, exams, and the final exam. These scores are weighted according to the percentages shown in Table~\ref{tab:weights}. Before calculating your course score, I will throw away your lowest one (1) problem set score.

% --- LETTER GRADE ---
%
\section{Letter Grade}
Letter grades are assigned at the end of the course according to the minimum course score requirements listed in Table~\ref{tab:lettergrades}. Course scores below $55\%$ are considered failing. Please see the course website for more detail about how your course letter grade is determined. 
\begin{table}[h]
